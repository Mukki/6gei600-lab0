In a terminal, run, at the root of this repositery

```bash
docker build -t armv8-env .
```

Then, you can open VS Code, use the `>Run task: Reopen in container` to connect to the Docker container and develop in ARMv8.

## Things you can do
You can use the VS Code tasks implemented to run the Make commands. Alternatively, you can run directly the Make commands.
